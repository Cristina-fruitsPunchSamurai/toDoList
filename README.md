# To Do List

Easy to use "To Do List"!:sparkles: This is my first JavaScript learning project and it was created in order to put into practice my JS lessons.


## Technologies

This project was created using : 
* HTML
* CSS
* Pure JavaScript
* A server-side language was not necessary as it uses a local storage functionality.





## Features

- Add new tasks
- Cross already-done tasks but keep them visible
- Delete already-done tasks by clicking on the waste paper basket
- Local Storage functionality so we can find our remaining tasks each time we open the website
